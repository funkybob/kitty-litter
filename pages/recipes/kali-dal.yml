I adapted this from a rather bad recipe in a book a friend gifted me.

The book version recommended whole tablespoons of spices, which was quite overwhelming.

## Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp ghee
- 1 cup urad dal
- 1 onion
- 1 long green chilli
- 2 tbsp ginger+garlic paste
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- &frac12; tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp Kasmiri red chilli powder
- &frac12; tsp garam masala
- 2 tbsp concentrated tomato paste

## Steps

1. put the dal into a pot with 2L (8 cups) of water, and simmer for 50 to 60 minutes.
   keep about 350ml of the water when you strain these.
1. roughly chop the onion and chilli, and blend, together with the ginger+garlic paste.
1. in a saut&eacute; pan on medium-low heat, melt ghee
1. add the cumin seeds; wait until they start crackling
1. add onion/chilli paste, and fry
1. add the rest of the spices; fry for 1 minute
1. add the tomato paste; mix well
1. add dal and water
1. simmer for 10 minutes
