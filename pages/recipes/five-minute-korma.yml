This is a small variation of a recipe from [The Happy Pear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_jGDOQIGHc).

I find their use of _tablespoons_ of spices questionable.  I use teaspoons, and it comes out super tasty!

## Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 260g jar char grilled capsicum (*see notes)
- 150g sliced mushrooms (I prefer oyster)
- 1 tbsp ginger garlic paste
- 1 can (400g) diced tomatoes, with juices
- 1 can (400g) butter beans, drained and rinsed. (or beans of choice)
- 1 can (400g) chickpeas, drained and rinsed.
- 50g raw cashews
- 1 can coconut milk
- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp sweet paparika
- 2 tbsp tamari

> note: I specifically select brands in herb infused oil, and use that oil to cook in for an extra kick of flavour.

## Steps:

1. add capsicum, tomatoes, cashews, spices, and coconut milk to a blender, and bled until smooth
  (if you can't fit all that, you can add the coconut milk later)
1. heat oil in a large saut&eacute; pan
1. fry muchrooms until they start to colour
1. add tamari, and mix into mushrooms
1. add beans and chickpeas, soak up remaining tamari
1. add blended sauce, bring to a simmer

Best served over rice. Since steaming rice takes so much longer than preparing and cooking this, consider using microwave pre-cooked rice!
