Recently, I was looking for a way to increase the [satiety value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satiety_value) of some of my dishes.

Knowing potato is high on the list, I tried replacing half the beans in my Rajma with potato.

After some tweaking, I had a dish that had people coming back for second (and even third) helpings!

## Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp ghee
- 1 med onion, sliced finely
