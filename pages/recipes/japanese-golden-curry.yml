This uses a product by [S & B
Foods](https://www.sbfoods-worldwide.com/products/search/016.html) to do all
the hard work.

This is more or less the recipe on the box, but I include Soya Wadi (aka Soy
Chunks, or Meal Maker) to round out the textures, and add some extra protein.

Soak 1 cup in a bowl of hot water beforehand, with 1 tsp of bi-carb, and a stock cube (I use
[Massel](https://massel.com/at-home/ultracube-stock-cubes/massel-ultracubes-stock-cubes-chicken-style-10pack/)
chicken), and add water and soya chunks together in step 3.

## Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp oil
- 1 onion, diced finely
- 1 large carrot, sliced into semicircles
- 1 cup soya wadi
- 1 stock cube (I use [Massel](https://massel.com/at-home/ultracube-stock-cubes/massel-ultracubes-stock-cubes-chicken-style-10pack/) chicken)
- &frac14; tsp bi-carb
- 2 med potatos, diced ~1cm cubes
- 1 pack Golden Curry mix
- 250g (1 box) Fabel mock braised beef

## Steps

1. together with the stock cube and bi-carb, soak the soya wadi in 2 cups of boiling water for 10 minutes.
1. in a medium pot, heat the oil
1. add onion, carrot, and potato; fry for ~5 mins
