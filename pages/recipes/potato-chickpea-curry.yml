This is my revision of the other "simpler" version, adjusted to be more of a conventional curry process.

The main difference is that by cooking the potato in situ, we keep the starches which thicken the gravy.

## Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 onion, diced finely
- 1 med green capsicum, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (400g) diced tomatoes, with juices
- 1 can (240g) chickpeas, drained
- 2 potatoes, diced ~1cm
- 1 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp vegetable stock powder (I use [Vegeta](https://www.vegeta.com.au/au/products/original/vegeta-gourmet-stock-powder))
- 1 tsp Paprika (or Hot Smoked Pimenton for the adventurous!)
- 1 &frac12; cups stock (I use [Massel](https://massel.com/at-home/liquid-stock/massel-organic-liquid-stock-chicken-style-1litre/))

## Steps:

1. in a large saut&eacute; pan, heat oil over medium heat,
1. add onion and capsicum; fry until soft
1. add garlic paste; fry for about 30 seconds
1. add spices to bloom, about 30 seconds
1. add tomatoes; stir and fry until moisture reduces
1. add potato, chickpeas, and stock liquid.
1. bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, until potato is soft.

Serve on steamed basmati rice.
