This is a revised version of my original recipe, that is slower to cook, but (I
feel) yields a tastier result.

- 1 tbsp garlic &amp; ginger paste
- 1 tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tbsp kasuri methi
- &frac12; tsp amchur powder
- &frac14; cup cream (optional)

## Steps

1. in a 24cm saut&eacute; pan on low heat, melt ghee
1. add cumin seeds; let sizzle
1. add onion and 1 tsp salt; saut&eacute; until starting to brown
1. stir through garlic &amp; ginger paste; saute 20 - 30 seconds
1. add coriander, Kashmiri chilli powder, and garam masala; stir and saute until fragrant; 10 to 30 seconds
