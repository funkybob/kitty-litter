This is a revised version of my original recipe, that is slower to cook, but (I
feel) yields a tastier result.

## Serves: 6

## Ingredients

- 500g paneer, diced ~1cm cubes
- 1 cup water
- 2 tbsp ghee
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 onion, diced finely
- 2 tomatoes (~400g), diced
- 1 tbsp garlic &amp; ginger paste
- 1 tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp sweet paprika
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tbsp kasuri methi

## Steps

1. thaw spinach; blend with water and garam masala into a fine paste
1. in a 24cm saut&eacute; pan on low heat, melt ghee
1. add cumin seeds; let sizzle
1. add onion and 1 tsp salt; saut&eacute; until starting to brown
1. stir through garlic &amp; ginger paste; saute 20 - 30 seconds
1. add chilli powder, coriander, and paprika; stir and saute until fragrant; 10 to 30 seconds
1. add tomato; stir and saute until it breaks down into a paste with the onion and spices;
1. add spinach and water; simmer covered for 5 minutes, stirring regularly; look for it to change to khaki colour

Serve on steamed basmati rice!
