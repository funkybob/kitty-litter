This is a minimal guide for setting up a minimal host server for Django.

When testing this I used a USD$5/month VPS from
[Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8698622), but any common VPS service will
suffice.

## Assumptions

1. You know Linux moderately well.
1. You are familiar with Django and virtualenv.
1. You have bought a VPS instance and installed Debian on it.

If you want to use a different OS/Distro, you will need to adjust some steps to
suit.

## Conventions

    :::console
    # this is a root prompt

    $ this is a user prompt

    (venv)$ this is a user prompt with the virtualenv active

## Preparing

First, we're going to do a little house cleaning and ensure our system is up to
date:

    :::console
    # apt update
    # apt autoclean
    # apt dist-upgrade -y

Next we insall the packages we need:

    :::console
    # apt install -y h2o python3-venv fail2ban git htop gnupg

Last, we create a regular service user for every day use:

    :::console
    # useradd -G www-data -m {username}
    # passwd {username}

## Postgresql

I always use Postgresql. Unless you have a _good_ reason otherwise, you probably
ought, too.

We're going to follow the [instructions from
Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/)

    :::console
    # echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
    # wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | apt-key add -
    # apt update
    # apt install -y postgresql

Let's take this opportunity to clean up:

    :::console
    # apt autoremove

Next step, we'll create a DB user for our app, and for ourselves:

    :::console
    # su - postgres -c "createuser gunicorn"
    # su - postgres -c "createuser -g gunicorn -d {username}"

## The Web Server

As a departure from the common place, I'm using a relatively new web server:
[h2o](https://h2o.examp1e.net/index.html).

It provides an impressive list of features:

- HTTP2 native
- HTTP / HTTPS
- FastCGI / Reverse proxy
- Strong focus on security
- Impressive performance

Beyond that, it is by far the simplest web server to configure I've found yet.

We need to replace the default config file `/etc/h2o/h2o.conf` with our own:

    server-name: "My site"
    user: www-data
    access-log: "|rotatelogs -l -f -L /var/log/h2o/access.log -p /usr/share/h2o/compress_logs /var/log/h2o/access.log.%Y-%m-%d 86400"
    error-log: "|rotatelogs -l -f -L /var/log/h2o/error.log -p /usr/share/h2o/compress_logs /var/log/h2o/error.log.%Y-%m-%d 86400"
    pid-file: /run/h2o.pid

    listen:
      port: 80

    hosts:
      default:
        paths:
          "":
            proxy.reverse.url: "http://[unix:/srv/www/gunicorn.sock]"
            proxy.preserve-host: ON
          "/static":
            file.dir: /srv/www/html/static
          "/media":
            file.dir: /srv/www/html/media

Now we can ask `systemd` to restart with our updated config:

    :::console
    # systemctl restart h2o

## The App

We need to make space for our app to live:

    :::console
    # cd /srv
    # mkdir www
    # chown www-data:www-data www
    # chmod g+w www

We can use `su` to switch to our user:

    :::console
    # su - {username}
    $

When we exit (or use ctrl-D) it will exit back to our root shell.

Now as our regular user:

    :::console
    $ cd /srv/www/

Make all the directories we need:

    :::console
    $ mkdir -p code html/static html/media
    $ chgrp -R www-data html
    $ chmod -R g+w html

Create the virtualenv, and install some essentials:

    :::console
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ pip install gunicorn psycopg2-binary

Checkout your code using git, and ensure the root of the Django project (i.e.
where manage.py is) is at `/srv/www/code`. Either check out the repo there, or
use a symlink.

For this example, we'll create a fresh Django project instead:

    :::console
    (venv)$ pip install django
    (venv)$ django-admin startproject sample code

Edit `code/sample/settings.py` to add:

    :::python

    STATIC_ROOT='/srv/www/html/static/'
    MEDIA_ROOT='/srv/www/html/media/'

And update the `DATABASES` entry:

    :::python

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'sample',
            'OPTIONS': {
                'options': '-c role=gunicorn',
            }
        }
    }

The `OPTIONS` section there is more for using `manage.py` than runtime; It tells
`libpq` (which `psycopg2` uses to talk to Postgres) to switch to the `gunicorn`
when connecting. We can do this because we added ourselves to the `gunicorn`
role when creating our DB user.

We must also remember to set `DEBUG` to `False`, and add our hostname to the
`ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

Before going further, let's create the DB instance for this app:

    :::console
    $ createdb -O gunicorn sample

And our regular django deploy steps:

    :::console
    (venv)$ python manage.py migrate
    (venv)$ python manage.py collectstatic
    (venv)$ python manage.py createsuperuser

## The App Server

For simplicity we'll use [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)

It's fast, stable, flexible, and well supported.

We're going to use the [gunicorn systemd](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/deploy.html#systemd) recipe

As root, add the file `/etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service`:

    :::ini
    [Unit]
    Description=gunicorn daemon
    Requires=gunicorn.socket
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=notify
    Group=www-data
    DynamicUser=yes
    RuntimeDirectory=gunicorn
    WorkingDirectory=/srv/www/code
    # Path to our venv install of gunicorn
    ExecStart=/srv/www/venv/bin/gunicorn sample.wsgi
    ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
    KillMode=mixed
    TimeoutStopSec=5
    PrivateTmp=true

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Next, add `/etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket`:

    :::ini
    [Unit]
    Description=gunicorn socket

    [Socket]
    ListenStream=/srv/www/gunicorn.sock
    SocketUser=www-data
    SocketMode=600

    [Install]
    WantedBy=sockets.target

And at long last, we can ask `systemd` to start our socket service:

    :::console
    # systemctl enable --now gunicorn.socket

Finally, to make sure it's all safe and reliable, we'll reboot:

    :::console
    # reboot

## And... that's it?

To summarise, we have:

- installed h2o
- installed Postgresql
- installed gunicorn
- installed our codebase
- configured gunicorn to launch on startup

This is a _very_ basic setup. We've not:

- [tuned our Postgres settings](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Tuning_Your_PostgreSQL_Server)
- [enabled pre-compressed assets](https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/file_directives.html#file.send-compressed)
- [determined an appropriate number and type of gunicorn workers](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/faq.html#worker-processes)

But as all of those are dependent upon your application, I won't delve into them here.

## Final comments.

The dynamic user feature of sytemd was new to me, and somewhat handy. It means
systemd will clean up after us, and our task won't have any persistent files.

Using the role switch was the only 'novel' step in this process, and one I'm
thankful to RhodiumToad on IRC for showing me.

My main issue with this setup is it requires root to restart the service when
you update/change your code/settings.

## Todo

Some refinements I'd like to make to this:

1. make it easier to restart the app as our normal user [perhaps via PID file?]
1. include instructions for TLS, and enabling HTTP/2
1. LetsEncrypt, anyone?
