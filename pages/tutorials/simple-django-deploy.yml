The following is a simple Django Deployment guide for begginers.

It includes steps to setting up a brand new

[TOC]

## Overview

I'll be using Debian, as it's generally current, doesn't bloat your basic
install too much, and has a good track record on servers.

A basic Django site requires 4 main components:

1. Web server
1. App server
1. DBMS (database)
1. and MTA (mail server).

Web Server
:   [Nginx](https://nginx.org) will act as our web server, accepting HTTP
    requests, serving static assets (CSS, images, etc) and media content
    (uploaded or generated files), and forwarding other requests to our App
    server.

App Server
:   We're going to use [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
    Whilst there are simpler solutions - like `gunicorn` - `uWSGI` brings with
    it a plethora features that are hard to ignore.

Database Management Server (DBMS)
:   [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/). Safe, fast, feature rich; It's
    really the best choice.

SMTP
:   We need this so our servers can email us when there are errors, and so our
    sites can email their users. `OpenSMTPd` has the laudable goal of being
    simple and secure - covering the common, basic uses, instead of getting
    complicated, because complex means hard to secure.

We'll be keeping the web sites in `/srv/www/` with the following layout:

- venv/ - the virtualenv
- html/ - static and media
- logs/
- code/ - where our project's code lives

## Before we begin

In this guide I'll assume some basic familiarity with using Linux and its ilk.

I will also try to abide by basic good security practices. This means, for
instance, we use `root` as little as possible.

One thing that turns up often is people are learning somewhere that "if it
doesn't work, sudo!".

**DO NOT DO THIS**{: .warning }

Using `sudo` is something you should only do when you _know_ you _absolutely
must_.

In this tutorial we will **never** be using `sudo`. In all cases where you
need to run something as root, either SSH in as root, or use the `su` command.

[Note: out of the box Debian does not include sudo. And I never install it.
Food for thought.]

As a convention in this document, any commands prefixed with `#` are expected
to be run as root, and those with `$` as a normal user.

Lastly, text editors. It's a personal choice. My preference is `vi`, but many
find this (understandably) arcane. In a default install of Debian, you will
typically have a choice between `vi`, `nano`, `pico`, and possibly more.

Use what you feel most confident and comfortable with.

## Setting up a Droplet

Make sure when registering with DO [to create a SSH
key](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2)
to use with them, and upload your public key to them. This can then be your
default way to log in as root.

Once you've registered with DO, go to 'Create Droplet'.

Any name will do - I'll use "testing" for this case.

The basic $5 droplet may not seem like much, but I've managed to host 7 or 8
small Django sites concurrently on one.

Pick any region you like - one close to you may reduce latency, but not
noticeably. You may want to consider legal jurisdiction of your data, also.

Select Debian, and go with the latest - 9.1 as of this writing.

For "Available Settings", you can leave them off for now, but when you get
serious, _do_ enable Backups.

Be sure to select your SSH key for installation [the box will colour in].

Now, press the big "Create Droplet" button, and about a minute later you'll
have your server!

## Preparation

Before we set up our services, we need to do some routine house keeping.

Log into your new droplet

    :::console
    $ ssh root@{your-droplets-ip}

First, we update the package data (remember, `#` means do this as root):

    :::console
    # apt-get update
    # apt-get autoclean

Now we update all our installed packages.

    :::console
    # apt-get dist-upgrade

Next, some packages we'll need:

    :::console
    # apt-get install python3 python3-venv fail2ban git htop

Some of this should be obvious (e.g. python3).

Debian by default doesn't include the `venv` module with Python, so we must
ask for that separately.

We use `fail2ban` to avoid filling our logs with the ever persistent botnet
failed logins.

We'll need access to our `git` repo with our code in it, which explains `git`.

And finally, I like to use `htop` to monitor my system - it's like `top`, only
a lot better.

After that, we clean up any packages that are installed but no longer needed.

    :::console
    # apt-get autoremove

Finally, reboot to make sure the latest everything is running.

    :::console
    # reboot

### Final step

Before we move on, we're going to create a non-root user to do our daily work
as. Just like not running services we don't need, we don't use root unless we
_absolutely_ _must_.

This helps to prevent mistakes; we all make mistakes.

    :::console
    # useradd -G www-data -m {username}
    # passwd {username}

This creates a `username` user, in the www-data group so we can edit sites, and
then we set the password.

In a new window, try logging in to make sure this worked.

## Configuration

### Configuring OpenSMTPd

We want to configure to _only_ accept mail from local connections, since we have
no need to receive emails, and don't want to be a relay for spam.

    :::console
    # apt install -y opensmtpd

The default config will only accept connections on localhost, so is good enough.

### Configuring Postgres

Installing Postgres is simple, and the default configuration is fine.

    :::console
    # apt install -y postgresql-11

The install will then prompt you to start the freshly created 'cluster'.

    ::console
    # pg_ctlcluster 11 main start

Postgres keeps its own list of users, separate from the system. We'll need to
create a user for our apps to connect as. In a more complex install, with
multiple apps, we would create a separate user per app, for better isolation.
However, for now we'll just create a "www-data" role, to match the www-data
user our web site runs as.

Here we use `su` to run the command as the postgres user.

    :::console
    # su - postgres -c "createuser www-data -P"

This will create a role for our `www-data` user, and prompt you for a password
for it.

Next, we create a role for our selves that is allowed to create databases, and
is added to the `www-data` role so it can create them owned by that role.

    :::console
    # su - postgres -c "createuser -g www-data -d {username}"

We could allow `www-data` to create databases, but it's safer to not. This
follows the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).

Since we're on a small memory budget, you may want to tweak some of the Postgres
settings.

You can edit them in the file `/etc/postgresql/11/main/postgresql.conf`.

Here are some settings you can tune for memory use:

- shared_buffers
- temp_buffers
- work_mem
- max_connections
- maintenance_work_mem
- max_stack_size

See [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/runtime-config-resource.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-RESOURCE-MEMORY) for more details.

Beware, however, that setting these values too low can have detrimental effects on performance.

Once you've adjusted these, restart postgres:

    :::console
    # systemctl restart postgresql

### Configuring nginx

Debian provides 3 different builds of nginx, with different options compiled in.
The smallest we can use is nginx-light, since we'll only be wanting uWSGI and
the "gzip static" module.

    :::console
    # apt-get install nginx-light

Now want to put the following in a new file called
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite` - the directory should already exist,
created by the `nginx` package.

    :::nginx
    # Allow gzip compression
    gzip_types text/css application/json application/x-javascript;
    gzip_comp_level 6;
    gzip_proxied any;
    # Look for files with .gz to serve pre-compressed data
    gzip_static on;

    server {
        listen 80;

        # The hostnamename of my site
        server_name *.mysite.com;

        # Where to look for content (static and media)
        root    /srv/www/html/;

        # Defines the connection for talking to our Django app service
        location @proxy {
            # Pass other requests to uWSGI
            uwsgi_pass unix://srv/www/server.sock;
            include uwsgi_params;
        }

        # nginx docs recommend try_files over "if"
        location    /   {
            # Try to serve existing files first
            try_files $uri @proxy =404;
        }
    }

We then remove the default site config, and symlink in our own

    :::console
    # cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
    # rm default
    # ln -s ../sites-available/mysite

Now restart nginx to take on the new config

    :::console
    # systemctl restart nginx


### Preparing the deployment space.

We need to make space for our apps to live, and the links for their hostnames.

    :::console
    # cd /srv
    # mkdir www
    # chown www-data:www-data www
    # chmod g+w www

## Creating the site

Note that some commands are once off for setting up the site, and some will need to be run each deploy.

Commands which must be re-run each deploy will be marked like this.
{: .deploy }

From here on, use your normal user account for all actions.

    :::console
    $ cd /srv/www

Make all the directories we need:

    :::console
    $ mkdir -p code html/static html/media logs
    $ chgrp -R www-data logs html
    $ chmod -R g+w logs html

Create a virtualenv, and activate it:

    :::console
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate

Next we make sure `pip` is up to date:

    :::console
    $ pip install -U pip

Check out your project into code/

    :::console
    $ git clone {github url} code/

This assumes your project is the top level of your git repo (i.e. where
manage.py is). If this is not the case, check it out into another directory,
and symlink the root of the project (where manage.py lives) to code/

    :::console
    $ rmdir code
    $ ln -s myrepo/myproject code

This should be the directory with `manage.py` in it.

!!! type "Next deploy"
    On your next deploy, you need only `git pull` from within the `code` dir.

Install your requirements

    :::console
    $ pip install -r code/requirements.txt

Create a database:

    :::console
    $ createdb -O www-data mysite

Configure your database settings:

You need to make sure your `settings.DATABASES` is configured correctly.
Ensure you have `psycopg2-binary` in your requirements.txt, and set your
`settings.DATABASES` to something like:

    :::py
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
            'NAME': 'mysite',  # the name you passed to "createdb" above
            'USER': 'www-data',
            'PASSWORD': 'thepasswordyouset',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
        }
    }

Migrate your DB schema:
{: .deploy }

    :::console
    $ cd code
    $ python manage.py migrate


And create a superuser for you to log in with:

    :::console
    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

In your `settings.py` ensure you have:

    :::py
    # These two are the default values
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

    # These settings might not yet exist in your settings.py
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(BASE_DIR), 'html', 'static')
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(BASE_DIR), 'html', 'media')

This way nginx will find `/static/*` and `/media/*` when it looks in
`/srv/www/html/`.

Now run `collectstatic`:
{: .deploy }

    :::console
    $ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

Next, we'll pre-compress our CSS and JS. This saves the CPU and memory of
compressing it on demand, and allows us to devote more time _now_ to compressing
it more.
{: .deploy }

    :::console
    $ cd /srv/www/html/
    $ find . -name "*.js" -exec gzip -9k {} ";"
    $ find . -name "*.css" -exec gzip -9k {} ";"

Don't forget to change your settings to `DEBUG = False`. When you do this, you
will also need to set `ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Since we configured nginx to match
against the host name, we can safely set it as:

    :::py
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']

### Configuring uWSGI

Bring in the parts of uWSGI that we need:

    :::console
    # apt-get install uwsgi-plugin-python3 uwsgi

Now let's add our uWSGI config.  Into `/etc/uwsgi/apps-available/mysite.ini` put:

    :::ini
    [uwsgi]
    procname-master = MySite

    # Now paths can be specified relative to here.
    chdir = /srv/www/

    socket = server.sock
    # Task management
    ; Max 4 processes
    processes = 4
    ; Each running 4 threads
    threads = 4
    ; Reduce to 1 process when quiet
    cheaper = 1
    ; Save some memory per thread
    thread-stack-size = 512

    # Logging
    plugin = logfile
    ; Log request details here
    req-logger = file:logs/request.log
    ; Log other details here
    logger = file:logs/error.log
    log-x-forwarded-for = true

    # Python app
    plugin = python3
    ; Activate this virtualenv
    virtualenv = venv/
    ; Add this dir to PYTHONPATH so Python can find our code
    pythonpath = code/
    ; The WSGI module to load
    # remember to replace "mysite" with project's name!
    module = mysite.wsgi

    # Don't load the app in the Master - saves memory in quiet times
    lazy-apps = true

And just like with nginx, we need to symlink it into apps-enabled:

    :::console
    # cd /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled
    # ln -s ../apps-available/mysite.ini .

And we can start it up using:
{: .deploy }

    :::console
    # systemctl restart uwsgi

If this works without issue, we can enable it to start on boot:

    :::console
    # systemctl enable uwsgi

## Congratulations! {: .booyah }

## Your site is live! {: .booyah }


# How does it work?

So, let's consider different cases and how each part reacts.

1. A request for static/media

    First, the client connects and asks for "/static/js/jquery.js".

    Nginx will get this, and the `try_files` directive tells it to look in the root, which is `/srv/www/html/`.  It finds `/srv/www/html/static/js/jquery.js` and returns it.

2. A request for dynamic content.

    The browser requests "/accounts/login/".

    Nginx looks, but does not find `/srv/www/html/accounts/login/`, so it passes the request to uWSGI.

    uWSGI then handles the request through Django, and returns the response.

3. Anything else

    All other requests will get a 404.
