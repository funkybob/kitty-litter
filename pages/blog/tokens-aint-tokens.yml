After writing my recent rant about token authentication, I realised there was
more to say on the subject.

Because not all tokens are created equal I feel it's important for people to
understand the differences.

So here's a quick summary of some of the common token types, and their relative
strengths and weaknesses.

## Some terms.

User: typically the Human wanting to allow systems limited access to their
resources.

Issuer: the system generating tokens

Consumer: a system that trusts tokens from the issuer.

Agent: a system which is issued a token to grant it rights with a Consumer.

Grant: authorization granted to an Agent by a User.

## Token Types

### Opaque vs. Parseable

Opaque tokens are meaningless to those who hold them and those who consume
them. They provide no information beyond being an identifier.

Parseable tokens (like JWT) contain data as well as acting as an identifier.
They can include a user ID, as well as authorization claims, and so on.

### Plain vs. Signed

A plain token can not be verified as having been issued by the trusted Issuer
except by asking them directly. And the Issuer must keep a record of all issued
and current tokens so as to be able to verify them.

Signed tokens contain extra information to "prove" they were produced by a
"trusted" Issuer. This is typically done by appending a "signature" to the
token (opaque or parseable).

Signatures may be done using either Shared Secret or Public Key approaches. See
below for more discussion on the relative merits of each.

Unsigned tokens are only really practical if the Issuer and Consumer are the
same system. Otherwise the Consumer must make a background connection to the
Issuer to verify each token. However, in doing so they can also verify each
time the token has not been revoked or amended.

Signed tokens do not require the Consumer to contact the Issuer in order to
validate it as a legitemate token. However, they do have the issue of becoming
outdated; since the Consumer does not contact the Issuer, these tokens can not
be revoked. The common solution for this is to make these tokens short lived,
and expire quickly.

To avoid having to have a User intervene frequently to authorise a new token,
Issuers will often also issue a Refresh Token. This token is only ever sent
between the Agent and the Issuer. When the Agent notices its token is expired,
it requests a fresh token "automatically" from the Issuer. If the Grant has
been revoked, the Issuer can refuse to issue a new token.

Some systems put the Refresh Token in a secure, http-only cookie. In this way
JavaScript Agents in browsers can't even access it, and the browser's native
cookie handling ensures it's only ever sent in requests to the Issuer.

### Open vs. Encrypted

For Parseable tokens, they may be raw serialised data, or encrypted.

Raw data can be read by anyone who can see the token, including the Agent.
Most JWT systems use this, which is why it's recommended to not use them for
session data.

Encrypted tokens are encrypted to keep their contents secret from anyone not
issued with a key.

Encryption may be done using either Shared Secret or Public Key approaches.

### Shared Secret vs Public Key

Shared Secret systems involve the Issuer and Consumers having a copy of the
same key.  Typically this uses a system like
[HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

Without knowing the secret you can not generate or verify a token.

Shared Secret systems tend to by simpler to implement, but require every system
having the same key, making them _all_ hacking targets.

This means the Issuer *must* trust *every* Consumer not to abuse the Shared
Secret to generate their own tokens.

[Public Key
cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) allows you
to safely publicise the Public Key (used for decrypting, and verifying
signatures) whilst carefully guarding the Private Key (used for encrypting, and
signing).

This also means none of the Consumers can generate a valid token.

## Which to use?

If your system is monolithic, simple opaque tokens can suffice. An example of
this is Django's session auth, if you treat the Session Cookie value as the
Token.

When it comes to distributed systems, you have more considerations.

Signed tokens allow Consumers to verify a token is valid without having to
contact the Issuer, but suffer the revocation limits mentioned earlier.

Parseable tokens can carry details of granted authorisation rights, allowing
for more nuanced Grants without the need to contact the Issuer to check for
specific permissions.

They can also continue to work as Opaque tokens when simply posessing the token
is sufficient authorisation to access the resource.

If your system is distributed, but private (all Consumers are under your
control) you might consider using a Shared Secret signed token, as you can more
readily trust your Consumers to not maliciously issue tokens.

If, however, you must support untrusted Consumers, you will want Private Key
signed tokens so only the Issuer can generate tokens.

## Examples

Most combinations of the above have been tried over the years, and
(fortunately) few remain.

1. HTTP Basic Auth

    This can be considered an unsigned, parseable token, as it contains the
    username and password base64 encoded.

1. Oauth2

    Originally this used opaque tokens, since the Issuer is also the Consumer.

1. JWT

    Commonly, JWT are Parseable and Signed.

    They support both Shared Secret and Public Key signing.

    Additionally, though uncommon, they support encryption.

1. [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/)

    This system builts on top of Oauth2, replacing their Opaque tokens with
    Parseable JWTs.

    Since Parseable tokens are backwards compatible with Opaque tokens, this
    allows existing Oauth2 systems to be retrofitted as ID services.
