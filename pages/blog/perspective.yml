Sometimes a small shift in how we think about things can greatly change the
outcomes.

Just over a year ago, a good friend introduced me to
[Parkrun](https://parkrun.com.au/). It's been greatly beneficial to my physical
and mental wellbeing to get out and run 5km every week, as well as spend some
time socialising with some genuinely nice people.

As my experience with running has progressed, I've had to overcome some
hurdles.  Aerobic fitness limits, this old body, endurance, and some mental
barriers.

Early on I'd find after about 1/3 of the distance, I'd start asking myself how
I thought I could ever finish.  And every time, after about 2/3 I'd realise I
was so close to finishing, and wonder how I could have ever doubted myself.
Eventually whenever that 1/3 marker came up, and that thought resurfaced, I'd
immediately recall what happened at the 2/3 point each time, and press on.

I still can't consistently jog the whole 5km, but I have managed it a few
times. So most times I jog until I can't, walk for a bit to recover, then jog
some more.

After a while I found it important to set a limit to how far I walk before I
start jogging again, lest I lose track, to the detriment of my final time.

Other times, I would pick a point and say "I'll jog to there, at least".  This
is a trap, and it leads to further self bargaining.

By picking a point, I've already accepted I'm going to give up; now that
nagging part of me that wants to give in has chip to bargain with.

Somewhere along the way, I changed this though to "I'll jog to there, and then
re-evaluate how I'm feeling".

It's a small change, and often times I still end up walking at that point.  But
I haven't accepted yet I'm going to walk, and most of the time I find I can
push further.

Then I can pick a new point, and say again to myself "I'll jog to there, and
then re-evaluate how I'm feeling."
