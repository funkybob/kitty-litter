So, 4 years ago [already??] I wrote a post about a shortcut to getting "User
registration with verification email", using very little code by leveraging the
password reset machinery built into Django.

Since then, of course, Django has moved on... and recently, the auth views were
rewritten as class-based views, which changes the game entirely.

As a result, I've committed to providing here an updated version of the
previous post.

A lot of the following is copied verbatim from the previous article, but I will
update the docs links (from Django 1.7 to 2.1) and clarify where it's been
found valuable.

It's important to note that you should do all of this right at the very _start_
of your project, as advised
[here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/auth/customizing/#using-a-custom-user-model-when-starting-a-project)

## Step 1: User model

This step has not changed much. We follow the steps
[here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/auth/customizing/#substituting-a-custom-user-model)
.

We'll start an app called 'accounts' by running `manage.py startapp accounts`

Then we'll create a User model in there, which inherits from `AbstractBaseUser`
and `PermissionsMixin`.

    from django.db import models
    from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin

    class User(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
        USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'

        email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
        is_active = models.BooleanField(default=False)
        is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False)

        # Admin expects these two methods.
        def get_full_name(self):
            return self.email

        def get_short_name(self):
            return self.email

Add to this whatever other fields you record against all your users - name,
avatar image, what have you.

Why `AbstractBaseUser`, and not `AbstractUser`?  Because `AbstractUser`
implements the default Django user model, and we don't want that.  Notably, it
includes 'username' as unique, and 'email' as not.

`PermissionsMixin` gives us `is_superuser`, `groups` and `user_permissions`, as
well as the right methods to participate in the normal permissions machinery.

Now we also need to add a custom Manager to help the rest of Django.

    from django.contrib.auth.models import BaseUserManager


    class UserManager(BaseUserManager):

        def _create_user(self, email, password, **kwargs):
            user = self.model(
                email=self.normalize_email(email),
                is_active=True,
                **kwargs
            )
            user.set_password(password)
            user.save(using=self._db)
            return user

        def create_user(self, email, password, **kwargs):
            kwargs.setdefault('is_staff', False)
            kwargs.setdefault('is_superuser', False)
            return self._create_user(email, password, **kwargs)

        def create_superuser(self, email, password, **kwargs):
            kwargs.setdefault('is_superuser', True)
            kwargs.setdefault('is_staff', True)
            return self._create_user(email, password, **kwargs)


You may be wondering what "normalize_email" does?  That lower-cases the host
name of the email address (everything right of the @) to avoid case clashes.
Many people wonder why not also lower case the mailbox name (everything left of
the @)? According to the RFCs, that's an invalid transform - you can assume
host names are lower case-able, but not mailboxes.

Next we tell our User model to use this by adding:

    objects = UserManager()

to your User model.

Finally, set `AUTH_USER_MODEL` in your `settings.py`

    AUTH_USER_MODEL = "accounts.User"


## 2. Registration

This is where the clever part comes.

Instead of creating all our own code to manage sending the email and verifying
the token, we can re-use the [existing password reset
machinery](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetView)
that's built into Django!

Let's face it, what's the difference between a verification email for
registration, and one for password reset?

We just need to hook in the existing views, and tweak them to use different
templates.

We will need to create a form, so in `accounts/forms.py` add:

    from django import forms

    from . import models


    class RegistrationForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class Meta:
            model = models.User
            fields = ['email']

Notice we don't put the password here. Later when the users passes through the
`PasswordResetConfirmView` their new password will be set.

Next we create a sub-class of the default `PasswordResetForm`. In
`PasswordResetView`, it's actually the form class that contains all the code to
send the emails.

This form has a `get_user` method which will query for Users with matching
emails, as well as `is_active` being True, and will then filter for those
having a "usable" password.

We need to change how it finds the list of users to send emails, since we
already have the User:

    from django.contrib.auth.forms import PasswordResetForm


    class RegistrationEmailForm(PasswordResetForm):
        def __init__(self, user, *args, **kwargs):
            self.user = user
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        def get_users(self, email):
            return (self.user,)

Now, we add our registration view to `accounts/views.py`:

    from django.contrib.auth.views import PasswordResetView
    from django.urls import reverse_lazy

    from . import forms


    class UserRegistrationView(PasswordResetView):
        template_name = 'register/register_form.html'
        form_class = forms.RegistrationForm
        email_template_name = 'register/registration_email.txt'
        # html_email_template_name = Set
        subject_template_name = 'register/registration_subject.txt'
        success_url = reverse_lazy('accounts:register-done')

        def form_valid(self, form):
            self.object = form.save(commit=False)
            self.object.set_unusable_password()
            self.object.is_active = True
            self.object.save()

            form = forms.RegistrationEmailForm(self.object, self.request.POST)
            form.is_valid()  # Must trigger validation
            return super().form_valid(form)

So here we're taking the existing `PasswordResetView`, and overriding a bunch
of attributes, as well as extending the `form_valid` method to save our User,
then replace the form with our custom sub-class of `PasswordResetForm`.

As a precaution, we set an unusable password on the user. This guarantees they
can't log in, and must complete the email verification to set as password.

Lastly we, create our `accounts/urls.py`. Instead of sub-classing all of the
other views, we can override their config attributes when calling `as_view()`:

    from django.contrib.auth import views as auth
    from django.urls import path, reverse_lazy

    from . import views

    app_label = 'accounts'
    urlpatterns = [
        path('register/',
            views.UserRegistrationView.as_view(),
            name='register'
        ),
        path('register/done/',
            auth.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(
                template_name='register/register_done.html',
            ),
            name='register-done',
        ),
        path('register/<uidb64>/<token>/',
            auth.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(
                template_name='register/register_confirm.html',
                success_url=reverse_lazy('accounts:register-complete'),
            ),
            name='register-confirm'
        ),
        path('register/complete/',
            auth.PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view(
                template_name='register/register_complete.html'
            ),
            name='register-complete'
        ),

    ]

This is a near exact copy of `django.contrib.auth.urls`, but for three things:

 1. We're using our own `UserRegistrationView` instead of `PasswordResetView`
 1. We've changed the template_names.
 1. We've altered the success_urls to point to our own urls.

Finally, hook these URLs into your root urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path(r'accounts/', include('accounts.urls', namespace='accounts')),
        ...
    ]


## Templates

Remember to write the following templates:

- register/register_form.html : Presents the registration form, including the `email` field.
- register/registration_email.txt : Body of the verification email
- register/registration_subject.txt : Subject-line of the verification email

See [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetView) for what context is provided.

- register/register_done.html : Shown after the initial registration form is submitted, after the email is sent.

This should instruct the user to check for the email.

- register/register_confirm.html : Displayed when the user follows the email verification link.

See [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetConfirmView) for what context is provided.

- register/register_complete.html : Final step, once password is updated.
