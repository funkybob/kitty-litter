This comes up a lot in #django ... and the solution is [as many are with
Django] much simpler than people assume.

Frequently I see people reach for formsets, in the mistaken conclusion that
formsets are for operating on related models.  The sad part is that formsets
rely on the same functionality that the proper solution relies on, but the
seeker does not see it.

Somewhere people get the idea that for a single &lt;form&gt; submission, they
can only use a single Form class... but the formset should show that that's not
true; it uses multiple forms from the one submission.

## The answer

So, as a simple example, here's a view that updates a User and their Profile in
one view:

    def user_edit(request):

        if request.method == 'POST':
            user_form = UserForm(request.POST, instance=request.user)
            profile_form = ProfileForm(request.POST, instancel=request.user.profile)

            if all([user_form.is_valid(), profile_form.is_valid()]):
                user = user_form.save()
                profile = profile_form.save()
                return redirect(user)

        else:
            user_form = UserForm(instance=request.user)
            profile_form = ProfileForm(instance=request.user.profile)

        return render(request, 'accounts/user_form.html', {
            'user_form': user_form,
            'profile_form': profile_form,
        })


The two most significant things to notice here:

1. the use of all() instead of ```user_form.is_valid() and profile_form.is_valid()```

    This is because when using `and` Python will "shortcut" the if clause if
    the first `form` is not valid, and so not run validation on the second
    `form`.

    May not sound like much, but imagine how tedious it will be for your user
    when, after they finally get all the fields for the first form right, a
    whole new slew of errors who up?

2. Two forms in the context.

    Just render them all inside the one &lt;form&gt; tag, and you're right.

    If any of the field names clash, pass a prefix= when constructing one of
    the forms, to prefix its field names so they're unique.

# Creating two related records

So the above works great if you have existing instances, but what if you want
to create two related models?

Fortunately, the answer turns out to be almost as simple:

    def user_create(request):

        if request.method == 'POST':
            user_form = UserForm(request.POST)
            profile_form = ProfileForm(request.POST)

            if all([user_form.is_valid(), profile_form.is_valid()]):
                user = user_form.save()
                profile = profile_form.save(commit=False)
                profile.user = user
                profile.save()
                return redirect(user)

        else:
            user_form = UserForm()
            profile_form = ProfileForm()

        return render(request, 'accounts/user_form.html', {
            'user_form': user_form,
            'profile_form': profile_form,
        })
